# DriverPass System Design – CS 255 Portfolio Submission

## Summary of the DriverPass Project  
The DriverPass project was based on a client scenario where a driving school wanted to improve and digitize how they offer services to students. The client needed a system that could manage customer accounts, schedule and cancel driving lessons, store test results, and offer online access to class materials. They also needed the system to be secure, accessible, and easy to use for both students and staff. I designed a system that included user roles like customers, instructors, admins, and secretaries, and created a clear use case diagram, class diagram, and technical plan to bring their vision to life.

## What I Did Well  
I think I did especially well in interpreting the client’s needs and converting them into a clean, functional design. The use case diagram turned out well and helped me map out the different user interactions clearly. I also made sure the class diagram reflected all the necessary relationships between users, lessons, and test results.

## What I Would Revise  
If I could revise one part, I would improve the layout of the activity diagrams. I felt a little rushed when creating them and would like to make the workflows even more readable and detailed if I had more time. This would help better communicate how the system responds to user actions step-by-step.

## Interpreting User Needs  
I interpreted user needs by paying close attention to the client interview transcript and organizing the information into distinct system roles and tasks. For example, customers needed to view their test results and schedule lessons, while instructors needed access to lesson schedules. It’s important to consider the user’s needs in system design because that’s what makes the system actually usable. If we ignore the user experience, the system might technically work but still fail in real-world use.

## My Design Approach  
When designing software, I like to start by thinking about the different users first—who they are, what they need to do, and what problems the system should solve for them. Then I use diagrams to sketch out structure (class diagrams), flow (activity diagrams), and interaction (use cases and sequence diagrams). Going forward, I’d like to use tools like Trello for better task tracking and prioritize wireframes early in the process to visualize the interface sooner.
